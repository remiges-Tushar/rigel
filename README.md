# Rigel

Remiges Rigel is a product which helps application administrators to manage configuration parameters and their values for one or more live applications.

This repository contains the source code for the Rigel server, client library for Go and the command line interface called rigelctl.

It uses etcd as a backend storage for configuration parameters and their values.
